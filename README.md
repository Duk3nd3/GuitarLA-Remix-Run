# Welcome!

##First Steps

## Development

From your terminal:

```
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

Then

```
npm run develop
```

You will also need the repository called 'GuitarLA-Strapi-CMS', which you can
also find inside my github. Once you get that repository, you will need to run
the npm run develop command via console to 'get start' the Strapi-CMS server,
since without that server the images and some of the product information will
not be displayed correctly.

Bye!
